## Lab 1

## Lab 2

## Lab 3
This paper describes a lab project focused on enhancing the stock trading application by implementing caching, replication, and fault tolerance mechanisms. The application comprises three microservices: front-end, catalog, and order services. Part 1 introduces caching to reduce stock query request latency, with cache consistency ensured through a server-push technique. Part 2 discusses replication for the order service, aiming to maintain data consistency and fault tolerance with a leader-follower architecture. Finally, Part 3 deals with handling crash failures and synchronization of replicas, while Part 4 entails testing and evaluation, including deployment on AWS and latency measurement for different request types.

In summary, the paper outlines a lab project that aims to improve the stock trading application's performance, reliability, and fault tolerance through the implementation of caching, replication, and fault tolerance mechanisms, with a focus on a leader-follower architecture and AWS deployment for evaluation.
